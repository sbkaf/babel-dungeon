        <p>
          Looking for a shortcut to learning {LANGUAGE} you entered the Babel
          Dungeon, but to your surprise, instead of answers, all you found was
          weird creatures creeping in the darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          They look weak but you realized that by solving their linguistic
          riddles, they become stronger!
        </p>
        <p>
          Adapting to the circumstances, you decided to train them and build
          your own army of minions to, one day, get out of the dungeon and take
          over the world, thus banning any language you don't know.
        </p>
      </div>
    </ConfirmModal>
